    review: I liked the first even though it was set in 2005/2006. The CGI was very
      dated but funny non the less. I kinda wish the ninth doctor would've
      stayed for more seasons.

    review: This season was kind of bad overall in my opinion but it did have some

      better. The added lore was really cool to see but the departure of Clara
      was kind of lame
